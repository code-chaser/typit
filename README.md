#### SCORING RULES
1. For each turn the score of the participant is equal to A/B (i.e. A divided by B) ;  
where:
      * A equals, in the participant's input sentence, the number of characters that are 'in place' as compared to the given statement and if that number happens to be less than 50% of total size of the given sentence them A = 0;
      * B equals the time taken by the participant to type in seconds;
2. Tie breakers:
   * Average Accuracy
   * Average Speed
   * Maximum Score among all the rounds
